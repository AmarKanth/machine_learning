What is one-shot learning?
- One-shot learning is a concept in machine learning where the model is trained to recognize 
  the patterns in datasets from a single example instead of training on large datasets. 
- This is useful when we haven't large datasets. 
- It is applied to find the similarity and dissimilarities between the two images.
