Explain the working procedure of the XGBoost model?
XGBoost model is an ensemble technique of machine learning in this method weights are 
optimized in a sequential manner by passing them to the decision trees. After each pass, 
the weights become better and better as each tree tries to optimize the weights, and finally, 
we obtain the best weights for the problem at hand. Techniques like regularized gradient 
and mini-batch gradient descent have been used to implement this algorithm so, that it 
works in a very fast and optimized manner.
