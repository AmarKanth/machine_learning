What is Linear Discriminant Analysis?
Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is a supervised machine learning dimensionality 
reduction technique because it uses target variables also for dimensionality reduction. 
It is commonly used for classification problems. The LDA mainly works on two objectives:

1. Maximize the distance between the means of the two classes.
2. Minimize the variation within each class.
