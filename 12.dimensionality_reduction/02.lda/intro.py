What is Linear Discriminant Analysis?
Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is a supervised machine learning dimensionality 
reduction technique because it uses target variables also for dimensionality reduction. 
It is commonly used for classification problems. The LDA mainly works on two objectives:

1. Maximize the distance between the means of the two classes.
2. Minimize the variation within each class.

How can we visualize high-dimensional data in 2-d?
One of the most common and effective methods is by using the t-SNE algorithm which is a 
short form for t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding. This algorithm uses some 
non-linear complex methods to reduce the dimensionality of the given data. We can also 
use PCA or LDA to convert n-dimensional data to 2 - dimensional so, that we can plot it to 
get visuals for better analysis. But the difference between the PCA and t-SNE is that the 
former tries to preserve the variance of the dataset but the t-SNE tries to preserve the 
local similarities in the dataset.
