What is Principal Component Analysis?
PCA(Principal Component Analysis) is an unsupervised machine learning dimensionality 
reduction technique in which we trade off some information or patterns of the data at the 
cost of reducing its size significantly. In this algorithm, we try to preserve the 
variance of the original dataset up to a great extent letâ€™s say 95%. For very high dimensional 
data sometimes even at the loss of 1% of the variance, we can reduce the data size significantly.

By using this algorithm we can perform image compression, visualize high-dimensional 
data as well as make data visualization easy.
