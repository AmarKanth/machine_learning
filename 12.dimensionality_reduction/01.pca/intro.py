What is Principal Component Analysis?
PCA(Principal Component Analysis) is an unsupervised machine learning dimensionality 
reduction technique in which we trade off some information or patterns of the data at the 
cost of reducing its size significantly. In this algorithm, we try to preserve the 
variance of the original dataset up to a great extent let’s say 95%. For very high dimensional 
data sometimes even at the loss of 1% of the variance, we can reduce the data size significantly.

By using this algorithm we can perform image compression, visualize high-dimensional 
data as well as make data visualization easy.

15. What is one-shot learning?
One-shot learning is a concept in machine learning where the model is trained to recognize the patterns in datasets from a single example instead of training on large datasets. This is useful when we haven't large datasets. It is applied to find the similarity and dissimilarities between the two images.

48. Why does PCA maximize the variance in the data?
PCA aims to maximize the variance because variance represents how much information is spread out in a given direction. The higher the variance along a direction, the more information that direction holds about the data. By focusing on the directions of highest variance, PCA helps us:

Preserve information while reducing the dimensionality.
Simplify the data by eliminating less important features (those with low variance)
