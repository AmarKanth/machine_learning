Bayes Theorem : 
It is enables us to calculate the probability of a hypothesis being true given observed evidence.
P(A∣B) = (P(B∣A) × P(A))​ / P(B)

Mathematical Formulation :
To derive Bayes’s Theorem, we start with the definition of conditional probability:
P(A∣B)=P(A∩B)/P(B)
P(B∣A)=P(A∩B)/P(A)

Rearranging the second equation to express P(A∩B):
P(A∩B)=P(B∣A)*P(A)

Substitute this into the first equation:
P(A∣B)=P(B∣A)*P(A)/P(B)​
