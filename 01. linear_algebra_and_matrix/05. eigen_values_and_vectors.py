"""
Eigenvectors are special vectors that, when a matrix (or transformation) is applied to them, don’t change their 
direction. They might stretch, shrink, or stay the same size, but their direction remains unchanged.

Eigenvalues are the scaling factors that tell you how much the eigenvector is stretched or shrunk during 
the transformation.

A = [[2, 0]
     [0, 1]]

consider two vectors:
Eigenvector v1=[[1]
                [0]] 
v1​ (pointing in the x-direction)
v1​ is an eigenvector with an eigenvalue of 2.

Eigenvector v2=[[0]
                [1]] 
v2 (pointing in the yy-direction)
v2​ is an eigenvector with an eigenvalue of 1.
