"""
It tries to find the best boundary known as hyperplane that separates different classes in 
the data. 
It is useful when you want to do binary classification like spam vs. not spam or cat vs. dog.
"""

"""
Hyperplane : 
The hyperplane is halfway between these boundaries(support vectors).
Boundaries are closest data points from each class.
"""

"""
Margin : 
The distance between the hyperplane and the support vectors.
