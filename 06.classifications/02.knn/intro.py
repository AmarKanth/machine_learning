What is one-shot learning?
One-shot learning is a concept in machine learning where the model is trained to recognize 
the patterns in datasets from a single example instead of training on large datasets. 
This is useful when we haven't large datasets. It is applied to find the similarity and 
dissimilarities between the two images.

Explain some measures of similarity which are generally used in Machine learning?

Cosine Similarity: 
By considering the two vectors in n - dimension we evaluate the cosine 
of the angle between the two. The range of this similarity measure varies from [-1, 1] 
where the value 1 represents that the two vectors are highly similar and -1 represents 
that the two vectors are completely different from each other.

Euclidean or Manhattan Distance: 
These two values represent the distances between the two 
points in an n-dimensional plane. The only difference between the two is in the way the two 
are calculated.

Jaccard Similarity: 
It is also known as IoU or Intersection over union it is widely 
used in the field of object detection to evaluate the overlap between the predicted 
bounding box and the ground truth bounding box.
