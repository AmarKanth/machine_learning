Population : Population is enitre set of individuals, objects, events, or data points that you 
are interested in studying.

Sample : A sample is a subset of the population that is selected for the actual study.

Randomness: Selecting samples in a random manner.

Representativeness: Ensuring the sample includes a balanced mix of the population

Types of data
1. categorical : describes categories or groups
2. numerical : represents numbers, these divided into two subsets 
	discrete : can be counted in finite matter(limit or range)
	continuous : infinte and imposible to count(time)

Representation of categorical data
1. bar charts
2. pie charts
3. pareto diagrams

Levels of measurement
1. qualitative :
	nominal : these are like categories, can not be ordered.
	ordinal : oridinal looks same as nominal but categories have order
 		  (Ex: High School, Bachelor's, Master's, Doctorate)
2. quantitative :
	interval : Interval data does not have a true zero point(Ex: temperature 0Â°C does not mean "no temperature")
	ratio : Ratio data has a true zero point(Ex: income of $0 indicates no income.)
