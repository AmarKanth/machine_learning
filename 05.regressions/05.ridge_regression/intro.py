L2 regularization(Ridge regularization)

-L2 regularization(Ridge regularization) in which we add the square of the weights to the 
 loss function. 
-In both of these regularization methods, weights are penalized but there is a subtle 
 difference between the objective they help to achieve. 
-In L2 regularization the weights are not penalized to 0 but they are near zero for 
 irrelevant features. 
-It is often used to prevent overfitting by shrinking the weights 
 towards zero, especially when there are many features and the data is noisy.
