"""
L1 regularization(Lasso regularization)

-It adds the sum of the absolute values of the model's weights to the loss function.
-This penalty encourages sparsity in the model by pushing the weights of less important 
 features to exactly zero.
-As a result, L1 regularization automatically performs feature selection, removing 
 irrelevant or redundant features from the model, which can improve interpretability 
 and reduce overfitting.
