Linear Regression :
A linear regression is a linear approximation of a causal relationship between two or 
more variables. 
Regression models are one of the most common ways to make inference and predictions.

Simple Linear Regression

y = β₀ + β₁X₁ + ε

y  : It is the variable we are trying to predict and is called dependent variable.
β₀ : Intercept(bias)
β₁ : Coeffiecient(slope)
X₁ : Input feature, it is independent variable
ε  : Error term

What is the difference between correlation and regression?

Correlation :
1. Represents the relationship between two variables
2. Shows that two variables move together (no matter in which direction)
3. Symmetrical w.r.t. the two variables: ρ(x,y)=ρ(y,x)
4. A single point (a number)

Regression :
1. Represents the relationship between two or more variables
2. Shows cause and effect (one variable is affected by the other)
3. One way – there is always only one variable that is causally dependent
4. A line (in 2D space)
