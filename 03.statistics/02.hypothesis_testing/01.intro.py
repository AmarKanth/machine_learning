H₀ : Null Hypothesis

"""
Null Hypothesis :
A default assumption that there is no effect, no difference, or no relationship 
between variables.

Example: The new product performs the same as the old one.
"""

"""
Alternative Hypothesis :
A statement that there is an effect, a difference, or a relationship — it's 
what you're trying to prove.

Example: The new product performs better than the old one.
"""

"""
Important Notes :
- In hypothesis testing, we either reject the null hypothesis or fail to reject it — we 
  never accept it as absolutely true.
- If the test results are unclear, we say:
  “We fail to reject the null hypothesis due to insufficient evidence.”
- If we reject H₀, we have sufficient evidence to support H₁, but we do not 
  ‘accept’ H₁ as absolutely true.
