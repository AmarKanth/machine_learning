"""
Z-score : 
It represents the standardized distance of the sample mean from the population mean.
It follows the normal distribution.

z = (x̄ - μ) / (σ / √n)

x̄ : Sample mean
μ : Population mean (under the null hypothesis)
σ : Population standard deviation
n : Sample size

if x̄=μ=0 then z=0 then we accept the null hypothesis.
if z falls into rejection region then we reject the null hypothesis.
