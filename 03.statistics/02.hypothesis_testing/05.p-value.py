"""
p value is the smallest level of significance at which we can still reject the 
null hypothesis, given the observed sample statistics

p < α   we should reject the null hypothesis
p >= α  we failed to reject the null hypothesis

The p-value for a one sided test is
1-number from the table

The p-value for a two-tailed test is
p=2×(1−number from the table)
